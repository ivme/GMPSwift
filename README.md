# GMPSwift

GMP wrapper for Swift

The library behaves like a framework, so it can be imported by swift:

import GMPSwift

The present library is a wrapper for Swift using only Swift. Presently only includes the IntMP type.
The type is conformant with the Int protocols, so it can be substituted one by the other without major dificulties.

Subscript and slicing functionality have been also included for the types Int, UInt and IntMP, in order to simplify the bit by bit access.

It also provides support for the power operator for the types Int, UInt and IntMP.

The framework can be installed using Macports with the Profile file included.
